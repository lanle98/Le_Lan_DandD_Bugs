# Le_Lan_DandD_Bugs
## This project is based on an in class Javascript lesson for Drag and Drop Function.
The original file has 2 bugs. First,  You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone. Second, when you want to reset the images, those images in the dropzone will still be there, they won't disapear.

I have created a branch for each error and they are named according to the bugs. Using "appendChild" and "While" loop are the solutions for this project
